## **Quick start kit for projects using sass**

Sass is indispensable these days for the development of a medium or larger application or website. With this repo, you can quickly start a project where you will use Sass with a minimal structure, but you can extend it as you wish.

## **How to use**
**Clone** it first just doing: `git clone https://github.com/Gray-Mafutala/html-sass-js-quick-starter-kit.git`.

 - **`npm install sass -g --save-dev`**: to install sass globally and as a development dependency.
 - **`npm run sass-dev`**: to compile the `.sass` files in the `./src/styles/sass` folder into css. The generated css files will be placed in the `./src/styles/css` folder as `.css` and will have the same names as the source files. *To be used throughout the development*.
 - **`npm run sass-prod`**: does the same thing as the previous command, but also minifies the generated *.css files*, and does not create *source-map files*. *To be used in production*.

 It's up to you :))
